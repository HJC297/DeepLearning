# DeepLearning

Based on Course work and Totorial from Imperial College London [460 - Deep Learning](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/current-students/courses/460/))

**Coursework 1: ML basics and fully-connected networks**
use PyTorch to implement and train a multinomial logistic regression model to classify MNIST digits.

**Coursework2: Convolutional Neural Networks**
Implement the Conv2D and MaxPool2D layer in ResNet-18 Networks without using the torch.nn module and the conv2d/maxpooling functions in torch.nn.functional

**Coursework 3: Generative Models**
implement two commonly used generative models:
1. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE)
1. A Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
using dataset [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).
